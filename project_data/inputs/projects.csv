Product,Customer.io,a rules-based email tool to help companies grow,"At Customer.io, I was the first employee, V.P. of Product and lead front-end developer writing Ember.js, HTML and CSS/Sass. I formed product principles, worked with the co-founders to prioritize features, conducted user research, designed mock-up for many complicated flows, and implemented the front-end code. While I was at the company, Customer.io grew from 10 customers earning $100 a month to 330 customers earning $50,000 a month in 1.5 years.",#start-up #user-experience #product-strategy #mock-ups #front-end-dev #growth,http://dl.dropbox.com/u/9927844/Jing/cio_thumbnail.png,,http://customer.io
Product,Venmo,mobile payment service,"At Venmo, I started the process of redesigning the new app. I conducted extensive user research and developed mock-ups to answer the following questions: What is the deepest need we are serving? What are our critical product features? What are barriers to adoption? I found that 1) people didn't understand the full range of use cases and 2) people found it difficult to sign up their friends. I prototyped and tested a new app that addressed these concerns. New app to hit the market soon!

Product,MoveTogether,taxi-sharing service,"Ridesharing is a difficult two-sided, supply-driven market problem. It's hard to incentivize drivers to offer a ride as they prize convenience and their quiet, personal time. However, ridesharing was more successful amongst close-knit communities. Therefore, my team pivoted to a one-sided market: taxi-sharing amongst the business community. We prototyped at the GoogleI/0 conference in 2011, matching rides to and from SFO. It was a big success.",#start-up #user-research #mock-ups #user-experience #cross-team-implementation #management,http://dl.dropbox.com/u/9927844/Jing/2012-02-11_1846.png,http://dthink.srb.ag/post/16748438250/movetogether-lessons-learned-from-ethnography-and-the,
Product,Yiftee,micro-gifting service,"Small business owners are incredibly busy and have difficult-to-integrate POSs. They do not have time to analyze rich customer data or train employees on new offerings. Their bottom-line is their major concern. Therefore, my team pivoted from an initial customer data product to a digital gift-giving service that was much lower touch and had a more direct impact on revenue.

Product,National Grocery Chain,monitor consulting,"This Canadian national grocery chain was experiencing declining pharmacy sales. My team designed and conducted a consumer research program consisting of an online survey, customer interviews, shop-alongs and focus groups to better understand the problem. The number one driver of loyalty seemed to be superior pharmacists and customer care. We put together a plan to better train pharmacists and to automate pharmacy processes so pharmacists can spend more time with patients.

Product,Sigma-Dek,DIY outdoor deck,"People desire the emotional satisfaction of building a deck themselves instead of contracting it out. But they want to be able to build the deck in a weekend and without many obscure tools. Therefore, the team tested the concept of a simple-assembly deck: pieces snap together, but are still stable, safe and strong, and the entire deck can be built in 45 minutes. This deck is now sold across North America.",#start-up #user-research #prototyping,http://dl.dropbox.com/u/9927844/Jing/2012-02-11_1853.png,,http://sigmadek.com/
Product,Marketing White Paper,monitor consulting,"This was a re-look at the traditional advertising mantra: market, media, message.

Product,Legal Services Company,monitor consulting,An emerging trend in the legal services market at the time was the use of semantic-based search for the discovery process.
