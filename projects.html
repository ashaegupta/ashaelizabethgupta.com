Itâs hard to incentivize drivers to offer a ride as they prize convenience and their quiet, personal time. However, ridesharing was more successful amongst close-knit communities. Therefore, my team pivoted to a one-sided market: taxi-sharing amongst the business community. We prototyped at the GoogleI/0 conference in 2011, matching rides to and from SFO. It was a big success.</div>
